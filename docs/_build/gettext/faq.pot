msgid "PancakeBunny is a new and rapidly growing DeFi yield aggregator that is used for PancakeSwap. The PancakeBunny protocol empowers farmers to leverage their yield-seeking tendencies to optimize yield compounding strategy on BSC. We are providing strategies for the various needs of farmers from the highest yield seekers to the risk reward optimizing smart investors."

Our goal is to expand the DeFi ecosystem, specifically on the Binance Smart Chain, while providing users with various strategies to maximize returns while minimizing risk."

# d7afc6add0c3478ca581ee4749650fb0

# 7f71e87bb6604137911fc15b2faf2949
msgid "Every Farm requires a different LP Token. Furthermore the different Farms represent different risk tolerances for Bunny users. A high APY usually means more volatility in the underlying token price. For example, BUSD-BNB has a much lower compounded APY than CAKE-BNB, since BUSD is a stable coin which is pegged to the dollar and does not experience volatility."

Although our code is not externally audited at the moment, we are planning to get an official audit in the coming months! As with all Projects we have seen in the past, from Harvest, Akropolis, and many more, there are always risks that projects will fall victim to malicious hackers. That being said, our Bunny developers account for the security risks of smart contracts and only will interact with contracts that meet the security threshold."

msgid "Because the APY is constantly changing on Pancake Swap, the Compounded APY on the Bunny Platform is constantly changing. Furthermore, because this APY is calculated via compounded (exponential growth), it cannot be calculated in a linear manner (i.e. APY/365) So long as you hold your tokens in our farms for an extended period of time, your assets will continue to grow exponentially."

This fee exists to maintain the smooth flow of the ecosystem and to prevent possible exploitation from individuals acting under bad faith. For example if there was no 0.5% withdrawal fee within the 72 hours, someone could keep depositing right before the compounding takes place and withdraw right after and still reap the same benefits and continuous long-term holders."

msgid "Let’s assume the APR of the CAKE farm is 365%. This means that on average if we divide 365% by 365 days, we get a daily return of 1%. Now since Bunny compounds this 1%, we can estimate the compounded APR using the following calculation: (1+0.01)^365 - 1 = 3678% Keep in mind that this is an assumption that only holds true if the APR of CAKE farm stays constant through one year. However, this is obviously not the case since the APY also changes by the second. We can use the same calculation for the rest of the Farms as well! Just divide the APR by 365, which would be the average daily yield. (1+daily yield)^365 -1 = Compounded APY."

# 92fec102b91f464fb7e9710527e952ca
msgid "The new maximizer farms put the daily yields from the Farms, into the CAKE compounding pools. The Stable Coin-BNB Farms have a current APY of 30%, but if we use the maximizer farms the APY increases to about 150%. This strategy is truly unique and advantageous since the principal investment does not get touched, and only the extra yields from the farm get invested in the more volatile, high risk-high reward CAKE pool."
