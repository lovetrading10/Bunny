msgid "BUNNY holders control the ecosystem and receive the majority of farm performance fee profits. In order to claim these profits, BUNNY holders stake their tokens in the BUNNY Governance Pool. Profits are sent to this pool in the form of BNB rewards. The amount of profits you recieve is determined by the number of BUNNY tokens you stake (%of the pool) you own. Later on, these governance tokens will be used to vote on decisions within our community. Thus the more BUNNY you stake, the higher your influence in the ecosystem."
